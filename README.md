## Things to keep in mind
Make sure that your code and files are:

* DRY.  Can I reuse parts of the code in different areas of the project?
* Well-commented. Will anyone else quickly understand what is going on in your application?
* Well-formatted. Write pretty code: indent properly, format consistently.
* Fully git tracked with dev and master branches with your trainers added as collaborators with an acceptable amount of git comments.

Weâ€™ll also be looking at:

* How you work together as a team.
* How you support yourself and each other to achieve a common goal.
